## Development

## Common Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so it has all their goodness.

These a few of the key commands:

| Command | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `npm start` | Runs the app in the development mode. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console. |
| `npm test`| Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br /> See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information. |
| `npm run build` | Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information. |
